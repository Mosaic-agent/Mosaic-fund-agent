> **COT look-ahead bias fix:** The COT subquery uses `WHERE addDays(report_date, 3) <= trade_date` to simulate the CFTC's Friday publication delay (data compiled Tuesday, published Friday).

> **DXY collinearity fix:** `f_dxy_proxy` (−USDINR return) is dropped when real DXY is available to prevent feature splitting on correlated signals.

## Confidence Intervals — Quantile Regression

Three concurrent LightGBM models are trained **per CV fold** with independent early stopping:

| Model | Objective | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `m_mean` | `regression` (MSE) | Expected return |
| `m_low` | `quantile α=0.10` | 10th percentile (downside bound) |
| `m_high` | `quantile α=0.90` | 90th percentile (upside bound) |

Each model's `n_estimators` for the final full-data fit is derived from its own average `best_iteration_` across folds — quantile trees converge at a different depth than MSE trees.

This produces **true 80% prediction intervals**, not heuristic ±σ multipliers. Example:
```
Expected return: +0.63%   [WATCH_LONG]
80% CI:          [−1.81%, +4.50%]
```
Asymmetry (positive mean, negative lower bound) signals a high-variance setup — the Risk Governor uses this to reduce allocation.

## Regime Signals

| Signal | Threshold | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BUY` | pred ≥ +1.5% | All signals constructive |
| `WATCH_LONG` | pred ≥ +0.5% | Mild upside — hold |
| `HOLD` | −0.5% ≤ pred < +0.5% | No strong edge |
| `WATCH_SHORT` | pred ≥ −1.5% | Mild downside — reduce |
| `SELL` | pred < −1.5% | Strong negative signal |

## Walk-Forward Validation

Uses `sklearn.TimeSeriesSplit` with a gap of 10 rows (2× horizon) between train and test folds — no look-ahead leakage. Internal early-stopping validation uses the last 15% of each training window; the test fold is never touched.

## Persistence

Every prediction is written to:
- `market_data.ml_predictions` (ClickHouse) — queryable via the SQL Explorer preset
- `predictions_log.jsonl` (repo root) — git-trackable for accuracy backtesting

### Model cache (joblib)

Trained LightGBM models are cached to `output/.cache/ml_models/goldbees_lgbm_<date>_<rows>_<splits>_<horizon>.joblib` after the first fit. Subsequent same-day calls load the cache (~2 s) instead of rerunning walk-forward CV (~30 s cold).

Cache invalidation is **automatic**: the `ModelCacheInvalidator` observer (sync, fires before `MLPredictionObserver`) deletes stale `.joblib` files the moment new GOLDBEES price data is imported. The next pipeline call retrains from scratch on the updated dataset.

To force a retrain manually, delete any `*.joblib` file in `output/.cache/ml_models/`.

### Parallel macro fetch

DXY (DX-Y.NYB) and US 10Y yield (^TNX) are fetched concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)` inside `_fetch_macro_series()`, saving ~1–2 s per run.

### Accuracy backtesting

Use the **"ML predictions accuracy"** preset in the SQL Explorer tab. Requires ≥ `horizon_days` of subsequent GOLDBEES price data before `actual_return_pct` is populated.

## Requirements

- ≥ 120 clean training rows (GOLDBEES + NAV + COT + FX)
- Use `--lookback 1000` on first import to build enough history
- macOS: `brew install libomp` (required by LightGBM)
